# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project on Odin!

This project will be a basic recipe website.
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

In this project I am going to make use of the basic knowledge I aquired in HTML.
By the end of the project I will have demonstrated how to set up a fundamental structure of a webpage and how to create direct and relative links.


This section is for my personal self-reflection at the end of the project:

I could not get a link to work and thought I had a typing error in the attribute, but then I saw I did not close the img element with ">". Rookie mistake, but it was a lesson.
